# DSCI 525 Group 23 Project
This group project is a part of the course DSCI_525 Web and Cloud Computing in MDS program - cohort 2021-2022 at University of British Columbia.


## Overview
The project is divided into 4 milestones, in which we will sequentially take on the roles of Data Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Infrastructure Engineer, and Data Scientist.

Each milestone is detailed as follows:
- Milestone 1: Get the data from web using API, process it, and convert it to an efficient file format.
- Milestone 2: Move the data to cloud, setup the infrastructure in the cloud and build a Machine Learning model.
- Milestone 3: Setup distributed infrastructure using Spark and run the Machine Learning model on Spark.
- Milestone 4: Deploy Machine Learning model in cloud so that other consumers can use it.

## Data
The data is from [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) about `daily rainfall in Australia`(5.7 GB).

## Report
All reports are stored in `notebooks` directory.

- Milestone 1: A summary of observations on challenges encountered while exploring different options to tackle big data local laptops and is documented in this [notebook](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-525-group-23/blob/e4135630430ad075a585b5a1614c33c72ee5a24f/notebooks/milestone_1.ipynb).

- Milestone 2: Setting up cloud instance, JupyterHub and server, moving data to s3 bucket and wrangling data for machine learning. This process is documented in this [notebook](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-525-group-23/blob/26653a242881b61fb2176e72ea143ea785d538be/notebooks/milestone_2.ipynb).

- Milestone 3: Setting up EMR cluster, developing machine learning model, tuning hyperparameters in preparation for deploying model on the cloud. This process is documented in this [notebook](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-525-group-23/blob/c41239efa21f7b5fee70873e5c11813394748a07/notebooks/Milestone%203/Milestone3.ipynb).

- Milestone 4: Deploying the machine learning model as an API using flask. This process is documented in this [notebook](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/dsci-525-group-23/blob/9e23689f3896a39c1db7db3519948e998a3256d4/notebooks/milestone_4.ipynb)
